# Computer Vision Final Project :camera: (May 2024)
- Created a new approach to improve scene classification accuracy by segmenting and removing foreground occlusions
- Utilized Mask R-CNN and GrabCut for foreground segmentation and the VGG-16 CNN for scene classification 
- Demonstrated through experiments on the Places365 dataset that our method significantly improved classification 


# Verilog Microprocessor :floppy_disk: (December 2023)
- Programmed and designed a 16-bit reprogrammable microcontroller in Verilog that accepts numerous commands such as branches, loops, stores, and loads using fundamental Register Transfer Level (RTL) design and logic devices
- Implemented and debugged the design on an FPGA board


# Artificial Robotic Origami Muscles :muscle: (December 2023)
- Developed a [robotic origami muscle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmlfSD72ihUo5MnrA1vJEbg4oKYCOsMa/view) using the origami zipper-tube and waterbomb patterns with pneumatic actuation to pick up a certain amount of weight when actuated
- Programmed an ESP32 to control when the origami muscle contracts and expands, also collecting data on its strength


# Sleepy.py :sleeping: (September 2023)
- Developed an AI-powered camera alert system that keeps you awake and enhances productivity 
- Trained a custom yolov8 detection model to recognize whether someone is asleep through live footage from webcam and Pythonâ€™s OpenCV library


# Princeton University Crossword :pencil: (December 2022)
- Coded a program to read in clues, display a unique crossword board, and allow users to play the crossword
- Used Java Swing framework to develop the GUI for crossword board display and playability
